## Built With ðŸ› 
* [Jetpack Compose][0] Jetpack Compose is Android's modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.
* [Coroutines][1] A Coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
* [Flows][2] Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
* [Compose Navigation][3] For tabs navigation using Jetpack Compose.
* [Dagger Hilt][4] Dependency injection library for Android.
* [Jetpack DataStore][5] Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally
* [Timber][6] Logger with a small API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Accompanist][7] Accompanist is a group of libraries that aim to supplement Jetpack Compose
* [KotlinxSerialization][8] Kotlin serialization consists of a compiler plugin, that generates visitor code for serializable classes, runtime library with core serialization API and support libraries with various serialization formats.
* [Turbine][9] Turbine is a small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines Flow.
* [Mockito][10] Mocking framework
* [Room][11] The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Espresso][12] Android UI Testing framework.
